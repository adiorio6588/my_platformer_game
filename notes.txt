(Part 1)
- Import pygame, and other imports needed
- Clock
- Variables
- Game window caption
- Create Window
- Game loop
- Add [pygame.display.update()]
- Add [clock.tick()]

(Part 2)
- Player image variable
- Player location variable
- Player movemenets variable = False

- Player keys when and not pressed in game loop
- Player movemenet frames [player_location[0] +4, and -4]
- Screen fill to prevent trails
- Created Player Rectangle variable
- Created Player Rectangle for collisions that tracks Player
- Created test Rectangle variable
- Drew Rectangle in game loop that changes color when the player collides
       
    if player_rect.colliderect(test_rect):
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255,0,0), test_rect)
    else:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0,0,0), test_rect)

- Created player momentum in game loop that follows the player's Rectangle

    if player_rect.colliderect(test_rect):
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255,0,0), test_rect)
    else:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0,0,0), test_rect)

- else statment flips momentum causing the player to bounce up
